## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/PROFILE.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I'm a sophomore Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University, passionate about harnessing sustainable technologies to solve real-world problems. Born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, I’ve been fortunate to experience diverse cultures, including living in Morocco, which has broadened my perspective and inspired my commitment to global engineering solutions. I’m excited to connect with fellow engineers and industry professionals, so feel free to reach out!
