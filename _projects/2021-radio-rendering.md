This project involved the design, prototyping, and rendering of a **multifunctional bottle brush** aimed at improving everyday cleaning for reusable water bottles. The design was conceived with usability, manufacturability, and aesthetics in mind, incorporating both practical engineering and branding considerations.

The tool was designed in Fusion 360, with multiple configurations and interchangeable heads for various cleaning tasks (bottle walls, narrow necks, lids). It was developed to fit comfortably in the hand while ensuring reach and flexibility in awkward bottle geometries. This was a deeply collaborative design effort, combining CAD modeling, hands-on iteration, and design for usability.
