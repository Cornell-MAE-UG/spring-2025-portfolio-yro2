As part of a computer science course, I developed a simulation framework to analyze performance in a fictional **Formula Sled Race**. The simulation modeled sled runs based on physics principles, incorporating **riders, sled types, and track environments**, all while simulating motion over time using **object-oriented programming** in Python.

The core challenge was to determine **which combination of rider, sled, and training strategy would win the race**, using performance metrics like velocity, distance traveled, and whether the sled completed the track.

Simulation results were visualized using matplotlib, allowing us to compare how different riders, sleds, and tracks performed under identical conditions. This also let us evaluate training benefits numerically and visually.
